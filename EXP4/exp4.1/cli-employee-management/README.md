# EXP 4.1 – CLI Employee Management System

## Description
This experiment implements a **Command Line Interface (CLI) based Employee Management System** using Node.js.
The application allows users to manage employee records through terminal-based menu options.

Since this is a CLI-based application, it does **not run on a web server** and therefore does **not generate a browser-accessible demo link**.
